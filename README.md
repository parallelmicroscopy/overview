# overview

These pages describe software and hardware for building your own <b>Random Access Parallel (RAP)</b> microscope. This type of microscope is also called a <b> Multiscope</b>.

### concept

A conventional modern microscope has an objective lens focused on each sample, and a collecting optic (i.e. a tube lens) that refocuses the light onto your eye or camera. One strategy for imaging many different samples would be to have many microscopes, each with its own sample; but this means you need a camera for every microscope. The approach used here is to instead construct a *parallel* microscope. The parallel microscope is conceptually like an an array of individual microscopes, with the difference that all share the same collecting optic and camera.  The system also includes a switchable light source (an array of LEDS), so samples can be illuminated one-at-a-time. Using a fast camera and LED array, we can image samples quickly enough to effectively make measurements from many samples in parallel.

### open source hardware and software

An open-source 24 well version can be built using a mix of 3D printed parts and commercially available optics, optomechanics and cameras.<br>
