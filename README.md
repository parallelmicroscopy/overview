# overview

These pages describe software and hardware for building your own <b>Random Access Parallel (RAP)</b> microscope. This type of microscope is also called a <b> Multiscope</b>.

### concept

Most modern microscopes have an objective lens focused on each sample, and a collecting optic (i.e. a tube lens) that refocuses the light onto your eye or camera. One strategy for imaging many different samples would be to have many microscopes, each with its own sample. A parallel microscope (i.e. RAP or Multiscope) is conceptually like an an array of individual microscopes, with the difference that all share the same collecting optic and camera.  The system also includes a switchable light source (an array of LEDS), so samples can be illuminated and imaged by the camera, one-at-a-time. Using a fast camera and LED array, we can image samples quickly enough to effectively make measurements from many samples in parallel. The system can capture an entire 24-well plate at full resolution in under a tenth of a second.

### open source hardware and software

An open-source 24 well version can be built using a mix of 3D printed parts and commercially available optics, optomechanics and cameras.<br>

For **hardware** see: https://github.com/parallelmicroscopy/24-well-RAP-hardware<br>
For **software** see: https://github.com/parallelmicroscopy/RAP-software

The hardware and software are rapidly evolving, so please check with [gil.bub@mcgill.ca](mailto:gil.bub@mcgill.ca) before starting your build.

### labs

The following labs have built their own versions of the microscope, some with unique capabilities:

- https://gil-bub.lab.mcgill.ca/
- https://www.corbettlab.com/
- https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/staff/carolinemuellenbroich/#researchinterests

Several labs are actively involved in improving specific aspects of the microscope hardware and software:

### teaching / design

Two senior undergraduate desgign teams in the University of Madison-Wisconsin are working on the next generation open-source RAP microscope. Check these pages and https://seniordesign.me.wisc.edu/ for updates.

### commercial version

If you want to purchase a commercial parallel microscope instead of building your own, Cairn Research (http://www.cairn-research.co.uk)
has a great one. Contact sales@cairn-research.co.uk.
