# overview

These pages describe software and hardware for building your own <b>Random Access Parallel (RAP)</b> microscope. This type of microscope is also called a <b> Multiscope</b>.

### concept

The original open-access concept paper is here:

https://elifesciences.org/articles/56426

Ashraf M, Mohanan S, Sim BR, Tam A, Rahemipour K, Brousseau D, Thibault S, Corbett AD, Bub G. <b>Random access parallel microscopy</b>. Elife. 2021 Jan 12;10:e56426.

### open source hardware and software

An open-source 24 well version can be built using a mix of 3D printed parts and commercially available optics, optomechanics and cameras.<br>
